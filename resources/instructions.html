		<p>Identify the difference between the two images in the selected set by clicking and releasing the mouse 
		on the location of the change. Differences could be:</p>
		<ul>

			<li>Change in color.</li>
			<li>Change in location.</li>

		<p><font class="bold">Start or Stop a Trial</font> by clicking and releasing one of the images 
		along the bottom of the application window.</p>
		
		<p>If a log file has not been created using the "Create Log File" option, in the same menu as these 
		instructions, the user must respond to a pop-up message box asking "Proceed without Trail Log?". 
		There are three options:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Yes - the trial will proceed with selected parameters without a log.</li>
			<li>No - A file dialog window will open to allow the user to specify the file name and 
			directory for a trial log. Once the log is created, the user may launch a trial by clicking on the image again.</li>
			<li>Cancel - This cancel the trial. The user may then consult the instructions again or exit the program.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p><font class="bold">The Log </font> is a CSV (Comma Separated Variables) file. It appends trial records to the file.
		Therefore the same CSV may be used to record different trials at different times etc..</p>
				
		<p><font class="bold">Mask Time</font> is the length of time a gray mask is displayed between the two images 
		in a set. The value may be changed by selecting the desired duration form the drop down, then pressing and releasing
		the "Set" button.</p>
				
		<p><font class="bold">Alteration Speed</font> is how quickly the two images in a set alternate. The value may be 
		changed by selecting the desired speed form the drop down, then pressing and releasing
		the "Set" button.</p>

		time for the last trial run.</p>

		for the currently running trail or for the last trial run.</p>
